# mlops

Some demos on how to do MLOps with Azure ML Serivce in R and Python

There are two applications here:

- componentnotes: trains a neural network model for NLP and deploys as a request-response API
- iris: trains a simple classifier in R and uses data factory to orchestrate training and batch scoring
